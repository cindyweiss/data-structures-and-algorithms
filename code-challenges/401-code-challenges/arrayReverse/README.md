# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. 

## Challenge
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
i created a new empty array to push into,
I utilized a for loop, starting at the end of the array, minus 1 since i wanted to include the last iteration in the new array. I did this specifically because itterations start at placeholder zero while counting actual variables we would start at 1. Then I pushed each itteration into new array using array.push.

## Solution
Embedded whiteboard image under assets file. I will have to work on getting better angles once I mount my white bard to a wall. But for now I took several photos of the work.
