# Challenge Summary
Insert and shift an array in middle at index. 

## Challenge Description
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
create a new function that takes in original array and new value
create a newArr 
create a variable midspot = (original arr.length)/2
for loop that itterates over original arr 
if(i === midspot) add new value
if(i > midspot) arr[i]= original arr [i]-1

## Solution
will submit once I have a chance to rework the code and white board this weekend.
